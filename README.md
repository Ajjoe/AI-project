This is a project I have commited to making to better understand AI chat models and how they can be utilized in software and coding enviroments.
This is a Car specification focused AI using the OpenAI library and api that creates a web browser AI tool with a fully working UI that is able to give automotive information on various makes and models using a JSON file as reference.
Through this I have learned how to make a assistant and how to create vector stores and how these AI models utilze and analyse this information
